- Per the task's requirements, the frontend SPA was built using React. The SPA encrypts the password received from the form with a key.
- The encryption process happens on the [backend](https://github.com/ZyroGatsby/encryptwave-api) and the state persists on page reloads.
- The deployed version of the SPA can be located [here](https://encryptwave.vercel.app/).

#### [Backend - Repo](https://github.com/ZyroGatsby/encryptwave-api)

- This was built using FastApi, A python framework. I used this for its ease of deployment using [deta](https://www.deta.sh/), and to show my versatility with multiple languages.
- The deployed version is hosted here [Backend - Site](https://encryptwave-api.deta.dev/)
